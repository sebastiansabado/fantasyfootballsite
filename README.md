# fantasyfootballsite
A database driven website on fantasy football team owners

The stats are scraped using the simple_html_dom_parser
The league homepage link is hardcoded into the script, in later versions I hope to be able to use the ESPN login to connect the script to the ESPN database. 

The database holds player information, based on previous seasons with ESPN.
